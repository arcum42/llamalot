# Chang## [Unreleased]

### Changed
#### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout Configuration Improvements
- **Unified Timeout Configuration**: Standardized timeout handling across the application
  - Default timeout increased from 30 seconds to 180 seconds for better reliability with large models
  - Settings dialog now allows timeout configuration from -1 to 600 seconds
  - Value of -1 or any value below 1 now represents "no timeout" (unlimited wait time)
  - Added `effective_timeout` property that returns `None` for unlimited timeout scenarios
- **Enhanced Settings UI**: Added tooltip explaining timeout options in Settings > Server tab
- **Vision Model Support**: Vision models continue to use extended timeouts (4x normal or min 180s)

### Fixed
#### üîß Settings Persistence
- **Timeout Configuration Saving**: Fixed issue where timeout changes in Settings dialog were not being applied
  - Added `update_configuration()` method to `BackendManager` to properly update backend components
  - Settings dialog now properly reinitializes OllamaClient with new timeout values
  - Configuration changes are immediately applied without requiring application restartotable changes to LlamaLot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
